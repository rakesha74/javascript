//Syntax Parser---A program that reads our code and determines what it does and if its grammar is valid. It translates our program to machine understable.

//Lexical environment means it determines where you are writing your code. It means it checks whether you have put code in right place or not. e.g.
//have you put  closeing brace or not if you used open braces. (need more research)

//Execution context

//Javascript engine creates one global object and this variable whenever it runs code by defualt.
//When javascipt runs execution context creates and it create two variable that is defined at top.

//at the global level this and global object are equal both are {} or window in case of browsers.

//in javascript global means the code or variable which are not inside the function

//in javascript if you define variable and function outside the function it get attached to global object and this.

//javascript is single threaded, synchronous behaviour in its behavior.
